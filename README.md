This is an example website where I have refactored existing code and removed unnecessary elements to make the code more concise and accessible. I have made several changes to the source code that enhance the user experience in a variety of ways. The first thing I did was fix some of the CSS that resulted in design issues that made the site look unpleasant. I changed every wrong color to match the aesthetic and the color pallete of the rest of the website. I also made it functional from a technical standpoint. I fixed 3 navigation links so now they take you to the appropriate paragraph of information. I also made the links more obvious so the user knows they can click on them now.
